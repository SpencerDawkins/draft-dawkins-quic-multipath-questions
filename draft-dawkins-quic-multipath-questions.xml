<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions that would "enable &#8230; multipath capabilities" (<xref target="QUIC-charter"/>) since the working group was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an extension, work on multipath, and the other extensions named in the charter, waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC protocol specifications (<xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"/> and related specifications).</t>

<t>After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication for the core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim meeting (<xref target="QUIC-interim-20-10"/>) to understand the use cases that various groups inside and outside the IETF were envisioning for multipath with QUIC.</t>

<t>As part of that discussion, it became obvious that people had a variety of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because they weren't looking at the same use cases, and so had different assumptions about how QUIC might use multiple paths.</t>

<section anchor="a-2500-year-side-trip-touchtheelephant" title="A 2500-year Side Trip (#TouchTheElephant}">

<t>The story that might have been titled "The People Unable to See and the Elephant" <xref target="Elephant-By-Touch"/> in 2021, is from the Indian subcontinent, and is at least 2500 years old (it is recorded in the Buddhist text Udana 6.4 <xref target="Udana-6-4"/>). The story, which has spread widely throughout the world, is about people unable to see, who are brought before the king, and shown an elephant - but they only touched the part of the elephant they were each standing in front of, and then began to argue about what an elephant was like (in <xref target="Udana-6-4"/>. Their descriptions were that "an elephant is like" a jar, a basket, a plowshare, the pole of a plow, a granary, a post, a mortar, a pestle, or a broom.</t>

<t>None were completely wrong (they had their hands on the part of the elephant they were right about), but none were completely right, either (an elephant was more than the parts they hand their hands on). And the king pointed to the monks of different sects who had been arguing about the teachings of the Buddha, and said, "they keep on arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The teaching is like this, it's not like that. The teaching is not like that, it's like this.'"</t>

</section>
<section anchor="back-to-the-introduction" title="Back to the Introduction">

<t>Let us turn our attention from "describing an elephant", to "describing what multiple paths in QUIC might mean", arising out of the QUIC working group virtual interim meeting minutes, at <xref target="QUIC-interim-20-10-minutes"/>, which include pointers to the video recording from the meeting, pointers to each presentation given, questions and answers after each presentation, and on discussion that continued following the cirtual interim meeting the QUIC working group mailing list.</t>

<t>It cannot be emphasized enough that multiple proposals for "QUIC multipath" have been submitted to the IETF (at a minimum, <xref target="I-D.an-multipath-quic"/>, <xref target="I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath"/>, and <xref target="I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-option"/>. In this document, "QUIC multipath" means only "QUIC using multiple paths", and draws from the discussion on the QUIC working group mailing list, some of which has been guided by one or more of the current proposals.</t>

<section anchor="intro2sm" title="Multipath Modes of Operation">

<t>For the purposes of this document, it's enough to consider two QUIC endpoints (QUIC Host X and QUIC Host Y) with two disjoint paths between them (Access Net A and Access Net B), as shown in <xref target="fig-arch"/>.</t>

<section anchor="ref-arch" title="Reference Architecture">

<t>Some use cases limit themselves to two paths - for example, the use case described in <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview"/> is limited to one 5G 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network. More than two paths are certainly possible - for example, two hosts that are connected by a satellite path, and two different landline paths from different network providers for redundancy. But I believe this simplified architecture is sufficient for discussion purposes.</t>

<t>Please note: as mentioned in <xref target="intro"/>, some readers will be thinking of an end-to-end QUIC connection between QUIC Host X and QUIC Host Y in <xref target="fig-arch"/>, while other readers will be thinking of QUIC Host Y as some sort of (explicit) transport proxy or tunnel endpoint, e.g. <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview"/>. This document is only focused on the multiple paths between QUIC Host X and QUIC Host Y, in order to talk about classes of sending and strategies for sending over multiple paths. However, it might be that further implications arose from the motivation of end-to-end multipath or intermediary multipath. In particular the latter will additionally require, according to <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview"/>, QUIC datagram (unreliable transport) and tunneling support. While multipath traffic distribution strategies play a central role in multipath transport, multipath re-ordering strategies become additionally important for multipath over unreliable network protocols. Possible strategies to solve this are described in <xref target="I-D.amend-iccrg-multipath-reordering"/>. Another complexitiy, not in scope of this document, is the interaction between multipath scheduling and QUIC stream traffic scheduling.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sending" title="Sending When Multiple Paths Are Available">

<t>This section uses  terminology from 3GPP ATSSS {Access Traffic Steering, Switch and Splitting, <xref target="TS23501"/>) to describe three different classes of packet sending that could be used when multiple disjoint paths are available. Note that these terms describe concepts that are not ATSSS-specific, and could apply to any multipath environment. If terminology more accessible to IETF QUIC working group participants presents itself, I'll change it.</t>

<t>Please note that the relationship between "flows", "packets", and "datagrams" isn't entirely clear yet. In <xref target="TS23501"/>, a "flow" is defined as "a set of packets that share an ordering constraint", which maps reasonably well onto TCP bytestreams and correspondingly onto MP-TCP bytestreams, but the core QUIC transport mechanism <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"/> provides multiple bytesteams in a single connection, and leveraging QUIC streams seems to be a use case enabler, whether for redundantly sending overlapping ranges, for efficiently striping non-overlapping ranges for bandwidth, or for strict ordering.</t>

<t>Further, with the QUIC datagram extension <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-datagram"/>, DATAGRAM frames can be carried in a QUIC connection, but are not part of a stream and do not interact with in-order delivery within a stream.</t>

<section anchor="traffic-steering" title="Traffic Steering">

<t>When a sending host has a new "flow", and has more than one path available, a sending host will select a path to begin sending packets on. This can be described as Traffic Steering.</t>

<t>Note that the selection of a path is "per-flow". Different flows may be steered onto different paths, but each flow will be sent on a single path.</t>

<t>The choice of a path can be based on a number of factors - for instance, whether the path will be used for bulk transfer, or whether an unmetered path is available. Those factors are important, but for this document, the point is that a path is selected.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="traffic-switching" title="Traffic Switching">

<t>When a sending host has more than one path available and is sending a flow  on a single path, the sending host can stop using this path for this flow, and start using another path. This can be described as Traffic Switching.</t>

<t>Note that the selection of another path is also per-flow. A sender can switch a flow onto a different path, without switching any other flows to that path.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="traffic-splitting" title="Traffic Splitting">

<t>When a sending host has more than one path available, the sending host may wish to use multiple paths simultaneously for a single flow. This can be described as Traffic Splitting.</t>

<t>Note that splitting a flow onto multiple paths means that the sending decision would be made on a packet-by-packet basis. No guarantee of packet ordering across paths is assumed.</t>

<t>Note that splitting a flow onto multiple paths, packet by packet, means that any ordering constraint must be provided by an upper layer metchanism. In <xref target="TS23501"/>, Multipath TCP <xref target="RFC8684"/> is used to provide that ordering constraint.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="traffic-steering-traffic-switching-and-traffic-splitting-in-the-core-quic-transport-protocol-and-datagram-extension" title="Traffic Steering, Traffic Switching, and Traffic Splitting in the Core QUIC Transport Protocol and Datagram Extension">

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"/> and related specifications support the selection and use of multiple paths for a connection between QUIC endpoints, as long as only one path is in active use at any given time. <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"/> and related specifications do not support sending traffic for a single connection on multiple paths between QUIC endpoints simultaneously.</t>

<t>This level of support for multipath allows Traffic Steering - the selection of a specific path - and Traffic Switching - migration of traffic from one path to another, using QUIC connection migration. It does not allow "Traffic Splitting" - the use of simultaneous paths for a single connection.</t>

<t>One important output from the QUIC interim meeting was the recognition that some participants view "Traffic Switching" as something like "protection switching" from an active path to a standby path, that doesn't happen often, while other participants view QUIC connection migration as a way of responding frequently to changing path conditions. This will be an important part of the conversation about multipath QUIC.</t>

<t>If a QUIC endpoint opens and validates two or more connections, no additional setup or signaling is required for a sender to switch paths - that can begin with the next packet queued for transmission. This would allow "Traffic Splitting" for unordered QUIC DATAGRAMs <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-datagram"/>, with an upper-layer mechanism providing flow ordering if that is needed.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="strategies" title="Sending Strategies with Multiple Paths">

<t>During the QUIC virtual interim meeting, various presenters described various sending strategies that they have used in the past (especially with TCP <xref target="RFC0793"/> and Multipath TCP <xref target="RFC8684"/>). and that they expected to use in the future with some multipath QUIC extension.</t>

<t>This section is an attempt to identify commonalities and gaps that may inform work on future multipath extensions for QUIC.</t>

<t>All of these sending strategies build on Traffic Steering - opening one or more connections for a new flow, and then proceeding to use one connection, switch to another connection, or split traffic across paths. For this reason, Traffic Steering isn't mentioned in the rest of this section.</t>

<section anchor="active-standby" title="Active-Standby">

<t>The traffic associated with a specific flow will be sent via a specific path (the 'active path') and switched to another path (called 'standby path') when the active access is unavailable. Traffic Switching is sufficient to support this strategy. <xref target="Alibaba-MPQUIC"/> and <xref target="Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS"/> mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim meeting.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="trading-latency-versus-bandwidth" title="Trading Latency Versus Bandwidth">

<t>Some applications require low latency, and others don't. So using a network path with lower latency for some connections, and using a different network path with higher bandwidth available for others. allows this strategy. Traffic Switching is sufficient for this, if measured path characteristics change enough to justify changing paths. <xref target="Chromium-Multipath"/> mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim Meeting. <xref target="Apple-Multipath"/> is actually switching paths at sub-RTT rates.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="bandwidth-aggregationload-balancing" title="Bandwidth Aggregation/Load Balancing">

<t>Some environments allow the use of multiple paths simultaneously for significant periods of time, because none of the paths are metered, so using all of the bandwidth on all of the paths simultaneously makes sense for bulk transfers. Traffic Splitting is required to support this strategy. <xref target="Alibaba-MPQUIC"/>, <xref target="Hybrid-Access-Multipath"/>, <xref target="Sat-Terr-Multipath"/>, and <xref target="Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS"/> all mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim Meeting. <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers"/> mentions this strategy as "Round-Robin" (not recommended) and "Weighted Round-Robin".</t>

</section>
<section anchor="round-trip-time-thresholds-minimum-rtt-difference-and-rtt-equivalence" title="Round-Trip-Time Thresholds, Minimum RTT Difference, and RTT Equivalence">

<t>Not all multipath environments include paths with significant differences between path characteristics, but several do.</t>

<t>A sender might select the first available path with a smoothed round-trip-time below a certain threshold.  The goal is to keep the RTT of the multipath connection to a small value and avoid having the whole connection impacted by "bad" paths. <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers"/> mentions this strategy as "Round-Trip-Time Threshold".</t>

<t>A sender might select the path with the lowest RTT among all available paths, in order to minimize latency for latency-sensitive flows. <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers"/> mentions this strategy as "Lowest Round-Trip-Time First".</t>

<t>If two or more paths have characteristics that are "sufficiently close" - for example, they may have path RTTs that are equivalent, from the application's point of view - a sender may wish to use both paths as long as that's the case, and then adopt another sending strategy when measured path characteristics diverge. Traffic Splitting is required to support this strategy. <xref target="Apple-Multipath"/>, <xref target="Sat-Terr-Multipath"/>.<xref target="Hybrid-Access-Multipath"/>, and <xref target="Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS"/> all mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim Meeting.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="priority-based" title="Priority-based">

<t>Paths are assigned priority levels that indicate which path will be used first. Concretely, the traffic associated with the matching flow will be steered on the path with a high priority till congestion is detected, then the overflow will be sent over a low priority access. Traffic Splitting is required to support this strategy. <xref target="Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS"/> mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim meeting.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="redundant" title="Redundant">

<t>Traffic is replicated over two or more paths to increase the probability that the traffic will arrive at the other host undamaged and usable. Redundant traffic may be used for all packets in a connection, or may only be used when measured network conditions indicate it should be used. Traffic Splitting is required to support this strategy. <xref target="Apple-Multipath"/> and <xref target="Multipath-3GPP-ATSSS"/> mentioned this strategy at the QUIC Interim meeting.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="combinations-of-strategies" title="Combinations of Strategies">

<t>As <xref target="I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers"/> points out, a scheduler can use a combination of strategies in sending decisions. For example, a scheduler might use load-balancing over three paths, but when one of the paths becomes unavailable, might switch to the two paths that are still available.</t>

<date month='October' day='20' year='2020' />

<abstract><t>The initial version of QUIC provides support for path migration.  In this draft, we argue that there is a very small distance between supporting path migration and supporting simulatneous traffic on multipath.  Instead of using an implicit algorithm to discard unused paths, we propose a simple option to allow explicit management of active and inactive paths.  Once paths are explicitly managed, pretty much all other requirements for multipath support can be met by appropriate algorithms for scheduling transmissions on specific paths.  These algorithms can be implemented on the sender side, and do not require specific extensions, except maybe a measurement of one way delays.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document discusses the issue of packet re-ordering which occurs as a specific problem in multi-path connections without reliable transport protocols such as TCP.  The topic is relevant for devices connected via multiple accesses technologies towards the network as is foreseen e.g. within Access Traffic Selection, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) service of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) enabling fixed mobile converged (FMC) scenario.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document briefly presents the Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) service being specified within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  The ATSSS service provides network support for multihomed devices to select a path for transmission (steer), move traffic from one path to another (switch), or use multiple paths simultaneously (split).  TS 23.501 specifies an ATSSS architecture for TCP traffic.  This document presents a snap-shot of the ongoing discussion in the 3GPP to enable ATSSS for non-TCP traffic, based on the use of QUIC, and assesses to what extent IETF specifications can be used to meet the ATSSS design goals.  Apparent gaps are also documented.</t></abstract>

<title>What To Do With Multiple Active Paths in QUIC</title>

<abstract><t>The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions that would "enable ... multipath capabilities" since the working group was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an extension, work on multipath, and the other extensions named in the charter, waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC protocol specifications.  After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication for the core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim meeting to understand the use cases that various groups inside and outside the IETF were envisioning for multipath with QUIC.  As part of that discussion, it became obvious that people had a variety of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because they weren't looking at the same use cases.  This document is intended to capture that variety of ideas, to inform further discussion in the working group.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.</t><t>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</t><t>This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as specified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily driven by deployment experience.</t></abstract>
